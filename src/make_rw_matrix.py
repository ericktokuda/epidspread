    Returns (and possibly constructs) a 1D numpy array with the principal eigenvector of a matrix, that is, the one
    with greatest (real part of the) eigenvalue.
    For a stochastic matrix corresponding to a random walk, entry i is the probability that an individual is found
    there during the STEADY STATE of the random walk.

    The eigenvector is normalized by its sum, so the sum of its components results in 1.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mat : np.ndArray
        The 2D square array with the matrix to be diagonalized.
    sparse : bool
        If True (default), assumes that mat is sparse and uses a specialized diagonalization method.
